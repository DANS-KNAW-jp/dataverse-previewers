# React-Previewers

This directory holds all the previewers provided in React automatically. Given a source code in the `react-source` directory, one can integrate a React previewer by attaching a `previewer-meta.yml` file which includes name and instructions to build the previewer.

Find more information on how to add your own React previewer in the following [README file]("previewers/react-source/README.md")
